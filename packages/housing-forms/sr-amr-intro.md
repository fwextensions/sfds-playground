The Mayor’s Office of Housing and Community Development (MOHCD) is pleased to announce the availability of the Senior Restricted Annual Monitoring Report (SR-AMR) form for Fiscal Year 2023-2024 (FY 23-24)

The SR-AMR was newly added to the Annual Monitoring Report (AMR) cycle as   a supplemental Senior Restricted Annual Monitoring Report (SR-AMR) for buildings that are contractually obligated to serve seniors, age 55 and older. See Section 1 below for more information.   


## Section 1: Senior Restricted Annual Monitoring Report (SR-AMR) 

In accordance with the  City’s commitment to racial equity and to San Francisco residents, MOHCD will be conducting periodic program evaluations that will include surveys, self-assessments and reporting on impacts and outcomes of its senior restricted, affordable housing developments. Beginning with Fiscal Year 2023-2024 (FY 23-24) AMR cycle, sponsors of affordable housing developments that serve seniors are now required to submit a Senior Restricted Annual Monitoring Report (SR-AMR).

Data from the SR-AMR will enable MOHCD to evaluate services programs at senior housing developments and to recommend and make improvements that may help seniors to sustain their housing for as long as they are able to live independently, with or without a caregiver.

Through the SR-AMR, Sponsors must provide information about resident tenure, non-housing basic needs, community-building, service coordination and linkages and other services. This requirement is only applicable to affordable housing projects that are contractually obligated to serve seniors aged 55 years or older. Due to the status of your building as senior restricted or having senior-restricted units, you are required to submit the SR-AMR. The SR-AMR report will be due on December 31st, 2024, for the period 7/1/2023-6/30/2024.

The SR-AMR report collects data on 7 service areas:

1. Resident Tenure
2. Annual resident assessments
3. Community-building activities
4. Non-housing basic needs
5. Training and skill development
6. Service coordination and linkages
7. Other services
8. Program Learnings

Responding to the SR-AMR will require input of the following data points:

a. # of late and eviction notices

b. number of surveys distributed

c. the frequency, name of service , # of attendees, for service areas 2-6.

Below is a guide and tool to aid in collecting the data. When you start the online SR-AMR, if you have the project’s data on hand, the report should take an estimated 20-30 minutes to complete. We encourage the services staff person preparing the SR-AMR to work with the on-site service provider and property management team to complete this report.
